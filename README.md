# Logistic Regression Package (Java)

**Logistic Regression** is a Machine Learning algorithm that estimates the probability of an instance
belonging to a particular class. For example, imagine we are tasked with building a Machine
Learning model to detect which customers are more likely to buy a product. The company can then focus 
on these customers by sending product samples to increase their chances of making a purchase. 
While **Logistic Regression** is effective for such tasks, it may not work well
in complex situacions, especially when we have large datasets, which is the case most of the time. 


## Technical Details
Now let's dive into the mathematics behind the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. We'll see the concepts,
equations and techniques that allows this algorithm to effectively estimate probabilities.
